# Reverse Words Instructions

## Setting the stage

You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European Bank Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backwards! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

## What you need to do

Write a function that takes a string message and reverses the order of the words in-place.

For example:

```js
var message = 'find you will pain only go you recordings security the into if';
reverseWords(message);
// returns: 'if into the security recordings you go only pain will you find'
```

## Good to knows

When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.

## Reminders

- Handle exceptions properly!
- Be sure to write some tests!
- You can find all environment specific information for running and testing your solution in `readme.md`.
