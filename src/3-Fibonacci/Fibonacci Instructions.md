# Fibonacci

## What it needs to do

Write a function that a takes an integer `n` and returns the `nth` Fibonacci number.

Let's say our Fibonacci series is 0-indexed and starts with 0. So:

  ```js
  fib(0);  // => 0
  fib(1);  // => 1
  fib(2);  // => 1
  fib(3);  // => 2
  fib(4);  // => 3
  ...
  ```

## Reminders

- Handle exceptions properly!
- Be sure to write some tests!
- You can find all environment specific information for running and testing your solution in `readme.md`.
