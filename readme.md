# JOOR JavaScript Take-Home Interview

*11 January 2018 - v0.1*

Thank you for your interest in JOOR. A major part of our initiative is to set an example for how software should be constructed, in both general application architecture, and in the details of each data structure and function.

We ask that you provide us with a solution fulfilling the below specification as a code sample. This should demonstrate your best effort and serve as an example of how you think an application should be designed. Write your solution, and refine it to be your best work. You are free to consult any resource, including people and documents on and off the internet, for advice and examples. However, we ask that all of the code that you deliver (excluding your npm dependencies) be solely your independent work.

## Environment

This environment is preconfigured with Babel, Webpack, Jest and necessary plugins to run this problem without need for any setup. You need some basic commands:

- `npm run start` will run your code and print your result in the terminal.
- `npm test` will run the tests you right and output your result.

## What we are looking for

- Familiarity with ES6 constructs.
- Manipulating data with clean standards in mind.
- Performant code.
- Ability to handle exception scenarios that may arise.
- Test coverage.
