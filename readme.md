# JOOR JavaScript Take-Home Interview

*11 January 2018 - v0.1*

Thank you for your interest in JOOR. A major part of our initiative is to set an example for how software should be constructed, in both general application architecture, and in the details of each data structure and function.

You will find three problems in the `src` folder, each problem residing in it's own folder, with a set of instructions. Please complete the solutions, upload this project to your github, and send us the link once completed.

## Environment

This environment is preconfigured with Babel, Webpack, Jest and necessary plugins to run this problem without need for any setup. You need some basic commands:

- `npm run start` will run your code and print your result in the terminal.
- `npm test` will run the tests you right and output your result.

## What we are looking for

- Familiarity with ES6 constructs.
- Maintainability of code.
- Using good standards.
- Performant code.
- Shows ability to handle exceptions and throw clean errors for non-happy-path scenarios.
- Test coverage.
